TELE(1)

NAME
      tele -- Provisioning at a distance.

SYNOPSIS
      tele [-h] [-d path] (init|status|install)

DESCRIPTION
      Tele is a small provisioning framework that allows you to run bash
      scripts on remote servers over SSH. It uses your own SSH, not a Ruby
      version, so you can profit from your settings and public/private keys.

      It uses the following directory structure to store the recipes and
      configuration files:

          .tele/layout.json
          .tele/ssh_config
          .tele/recipes/redis/status.sh
          .tele/recipes/redis/install.sh
          .tele/recipes/unicorn/status.sh
          .tele/recipes/unicorn/install.sh

      In the example, there are recipes for Redis and Unicorn. Please note that you are in
      charge of creating them.

      layout.json
          The server layout, with the available roles and servers. Example:

          {
            "roles": {
              "db": ["redis"],
              "web": ["ruby", "unicorn"],
              "app": ["db", "web"]
            },

            "servers": {
              "app-1": ["db", "web"],
              "app-2": ["db"],
              "app-3": ["app"]
            }
          }

          The key "roles" stores a tree, where each key is mapped
          to an array of recipes. The leaves--those elements in the tree that
          are not present as keys--are the ones that have to be available as
          bash scripts. In this example, both "redis" and "unicorn" are leaves,
          while "db", "web" and "app" are recipes composed of other recipes.

          The key "servers" stores a map of servers to roles. The keys can be
          either hostnames declared in .tele/ssh_config or IP addresses.

      ssh_config
          Configuration file for the SSH connection. Check the SSH_CONFIG man
          page for more information.

      The following options are available:

      -h
          Display this help message.

      -d path
          Sets path as the directory where tele will search for scripts and
          configuration files. You can also use the environment variable
          TELE_HOME.

      init
          Copies a .tele template to the current directory.

      status
          Runs every status.sh script on the servers declared in layout.json,
          and prints the responses. The status.sh script must return 0 if
          everything is correct, and a value different form zero otherwise.
          What to check in the script is up to the user.

      install
          Runs every install.sh script on the servers declared in layout.json,
          but only if the status.sh returns an error. The exit code must be 0
          if the installation was successful.

USAGE
      To provision two servers called `server1` and `server2` with Redis,
      starting from scratch:

          # Create the .tele directory.
          $ tele init

          # Create directories for the recipes.
          $ mkdir -p .tele/recipes/redis

          # Create status.sh script.
          $ echo "which redis-server" > ./tele/recipes/redis/status.sh

          # Create install.sh script (ommited).

          # Edit .tele/layout.json as follows:

            {
              "roles": {
                "db": ["redis"]
              },

              "servers": {
                "server1": ["db"],
                "server2": ["db"]
              }
            }

          # Edit .tele/ssh_config:

            Host server1
              Hostname 10.0.0.1

            Host server2
              Hostname 10.0.0.2

          # Run tele install
          $ tele install

INSTALLATION
      $ gem install tele
